I'm making this bot to help DM's and GM's when it comes to having voice npcs for their TTRPG games. Right now it's basic but it does work.
you need a Discord token and an ElevenLabs API key of your own. It has some FFMPEG dependencies you'll have to install for it to work. 
my end goal is to have this in an exe format for anyone to use with out having to use a CMD prompt or have even lass python knowledge than I do.
